Referral boundaries should not be misinterpreted as development footprints but where referrals have been received by the Department. It should be noted that not all referrals captured within the Referrals Spatial Database, are assessed and approved by the Minister for the Environment, as some are withdrawn before assessment can take place. For more detailed information on a referral a URL is provided to the EPBC Act Public notices pages. \nStatus and detailed planning documentation is available on the EPBC Act Public notices (http://epbcnotices.environment.gov.au/referralslist/). This includes some summary statistics and public notifications. In the first instance where a proponent provides GIS data through a referral application, this is loaded as the polygons for a referral. Where this doesn't exist other means to digitise boundaries are employed to provide a relatively accurate reflection of the maximum extent for which the referral may impact. This sometimes takes the form of heads up digitising planning documents, sourcing from other state databases (such as PSMA Australia) features and coordinates supplied through the application forms.",

The guidelines define 'habitat critical to the survival of a species' as areas necessary:\n• activities such as foraging, breeding or dispersal\n• for the long-term maintenance of the species (including the maintenance of species essential to the survival of the species)\n• to maintain genetic diversity and long term evolutionary development\n• for the reintroduction of populations or recovery of the species.\n\nThe mapped areas were identified by consensus of a panel of experts in marine turtle biology.",

It involves quarterly counts at all known daytime roost sites of grey-headed and spectacled flying-foxes across both species' national ranges, and at black and little-red flying-fox camps where those camps occur within the range of the previous two species or outside these ranges, where monitoring is possible. The aim of the program is to establish a reliable benchmark for flying-fox populations in 2013 and monitor trends in abundance and distribution in subsequent years. Counts are carried out using a robust scientific methodology developed by the CSIRO Land and Water (this method is described at http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/391f5fed-e287-4dd3-85ac-640037926ef5/files/310112-monitoring-methodology.pdf,  http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/status-and-trends-australias-epbc-listed-flying-foxes). The first full NFFMP census of grey-headed flying-foxes took place on 14-16 February 2013 and was the most comprehensive survey ever undertaken for this species. \n\nThe NFFMP is coordinated by CSIRO Land and Water and Department of Environment in collaboration with the participating state governments.\n\nThis dataset contains all the flying-fox census data collected under the NFFMP (up to and including survey results reflected in the data revision date).\n",

It involves quarterly counts at all known daytime roost sites of grey-headed and spectacled flying-foxes across both species' national ranges, and at black and little-red flying-fox camps where those camps occur within the range of the previous two species or outside these ranges, where monitoring is possible. The aim of the program is to establish a reliable benchmark for flying-fox populations in 2013 and monitor trends in abundance and distribution in subsequent years. Counts are carried out using a robust scientific methodology developed by the CSIRO Land and Water (this method is described at http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/391f5fed-e287-4dd3-85ac-640037926ef5/files/310112-monitoring-methodology.pdf,  http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/status-and-trends-australias-epbc-listed-flying-foxes). The first full NFFMP census of grey-headed flying-foxes took place on 14-16 February 2013 and was the most comprehensive survey ever undertaken for this species. \n\nThe NFFMP is coordinated by CSIRO Land and Water and Department of Environment in collaboration with the participating state governments.\n\nThis dataset contains all the flying-fox census data collected under the NFFMP (up to and including survey results reflected in the data revision date).\n",

                "description": "In conjunction with the National Carp Control Plan the Department has developed the Carp capture tool. This tool is being used during the consultation phase of the potential release of the Carp herpes virus, to capture the known location of Carp and information about these sites to help policy makers understand the potential impacts of the invasive species. Key stakeholders involved in data collection for Carp include Natural Resource Management groups, local government areas and other targeted stakeholders. \nObservation point records for Cyprinus carpio were retrieved from the Department's Species Profile and Threats database and the Atlas of Living Australia (June 2018). Geographic range descriptions and habitat information were also sourced from available scientific literature and recent academic research. Jurisdictional information (including location descriptions and geospatial data) was specifically sought from the States and Territories as well as the Murray Darling Basin Authority to confirm the known presence of the species in Australia’s waterways. \nThe habitat layers used to create this distribution comprise the relevant features of the: a) DEM derived AHGF Network Stream data (Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric v2.1.1); b) the waterbody features captured in the Geodata Topo250k v4.0 product suite (Geoscience Australia); and, c) the 1-in-100 year flood boundary for the Murray-Darling Basin. These features were all buffered by 250m to create an area (polygon) extent and compensate for any spatial inaccuracies in the source data.\nThe ‘known to occur’distribution comprises the main stream segments located between the furthest upstream and downstream observed or described locations (including a 5 km buffer either side of these outer locations). Any perennial waterbody features in contact with known stream segments or described as containing the species were also captured in the ‘known to occur’presence category.\nThe likely distribution comprises the stream segments (up to 5km) throughout the network that are in contact with the known extent. Any perennial waterbodies occurring within 1 km of known extents were also captured in the ‘likely to occur’presence category. \nThe may distribution comprises all of the remaining major stream segments and waterbodies found within the drainage basins known to contain the species. The 1-in-100 MDB flood extent was also captured in the ‘may occur’ presence category.\nThe dataset is a gridded polygon dataset at a 100m resolution. This is the final version of the dataset with edits made based on additional information from the Carp capture tool and consultations with key stakeholders.",
